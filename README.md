#### _a few words_
Hello, my name is Hengle Li. I also go by Eric, because there are so many various pronunciations of my first name, I don't want to bother anymore. 
I am from China, and I went to college in UC Berkeley, as a sociology major. My research interests are social change, sociological theories, and political sociology. Bourdieu is my favorite, though I hate his writing style. After Bourdieu, I like Marx the best, because he's one of the few sociologists that know how to write properly for people to read their texts.  
I have no programming experience before, so all these are like dark magic to me. Cheers!

##### _a few more words_
There's a [story](https://www.booksie.com/539766-dark-and-white) I have been working on since high school. Don't ask me why the plots are so sloppy, or when it's going to be finished. __I don't know.__

###### P.S. 
1. Please keep the link away from kids. The story is R level.
2. Just kidding. It's PG-13.
